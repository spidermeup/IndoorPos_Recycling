Hi folks! as you can imagine we are not allowed to move much.

I have found an interesting library for map depiction

it is this one https://github.com/kivy-garden/garden.mapview

i tried it and it works like a charm and you can even load your own map.


You can save the MAC address with the signals whenever you want. But it will be best to do it when the school is active (meaining during the day) this way you can get an accurate measurement for when people are walking around (which will slightly affect the readings).

About the coronavirus: Have your report ready regardless, don't bank on any delays.

As a test could you please write in your readme file that you are seeing these?

23/3/2020: No worries so now i have a channel to talk to all of you from here (or at least some of you.) Whoevers sees this can you send an email to the others so they are aware of the conversation? Awesome thanks!
  For the Mac Address and signal strength to coordinates it is very simple: In python you can store lists of tuples so you can have a list called fingerprints that has the coordinates X and Y, then a list of tuples that include MAC addresses and the signal strength for each address. This would look like below:

This is what the structure looks like try making it and insert fake numbers like the ones i have shown above to see if it works in theory.

  On another note I will try take a look probably some time this week at mapview and fix it for you folks, but i have been busy with adapting my flat to WFH and also a paper deadline!
