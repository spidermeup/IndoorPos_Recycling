Hi folks! as you can imagine we are not allowed to move much.

I have found an interesting library for map depiction

it is this one https://github.com/kivy-garden/garden.mapview

i tried it and it works like a charm and you can even load your own map.


You can save the MAC address with the signals whenever you want. But it will be best to do it when the school is active (meaining during the day) this way you can get an accurate measurement for when people are walking around (which will slightly affect the readings).

About the coronavirus: Have your report ready regardless, don't bank on any delays.

As a test could you please write in your readme file that you are seeing these?
