I think the report was too short!

for a start have a section in the beginning saying what the technical difficulties of the the problem are. For example, you can describe why normal GPS signal wouldnt work, and why just triangulating with wifi signals also doesnt work because the signal does not predictably drop its quality with increased distance. Then you can talk about fingerprinting and explain that it solves the problem of the wifi signal because it effectively creates a mental map of how the signals change in space. On this note, there are many aspects of fingerprinting never mentioned. Collecting the fingerprints from every location (the offline phase) and how it works when a user wants to find out where they are (online phase)

The other parts also need more information. currently they have a screenshot and just a few sentences. you need to explain what is shown in the images and you need to explain what you did to achieve it. Its ok to say we did not build and deploy it in school as we were shut off, but we tested the individual parts and they work, here is all the theory of how it would work step by step.

NN and the QR scanner are not of equal importance. In the QR case you just use a library and it works out of the box. the other case you need to understand the method and apply it to your problem. Dont be afraid to make mistakes on how it works with NN. I am here to help you out and correct those. before i tell you what to write though, you should have some detailed text of your own.

He had discussed the problems of privacy and motivating people to recycle and use the app. You could have a section explaining how nothing is stored on a server and everything can be stored locally on peoples phones (the fingerprints). When someone tries to find the location they only need to access the fingerprints collected by you guys during the calibration phase and compare his wifi signals to that.

For the motivation, you could talk that one of the plans was to make it into a contest where the people with the best recycling score would be able to receive some reward from the school, at the end of the year. and talk a bit about how you envision the logistics of making sure that you could accurately count how many products people were actually recycling. This needs more thought, but i think it would really help the report if you had it in there as it shows a complete vision for your project.

We can then firm up the conclusion a bit and showcase all the amazing things you folks achieved.
